Until recently (in astronomical terms) it must have been quite active creating a haze or halo of debris much like Sol's Oort Cloud around the system's fringes. This halo can be spotted from a distance tens of light years away although due to lacking a central star with enough luminosity it is not entirely clear what makes it reflect light. Orbiting the Black Hole are several celestials including an incredibly fast spinning Jovian gas giant which is clearly ellipsoid in shape. The gas giant rotates once every 0.7 standard days.\r\n\r\nThe system is named after the ancient poem by author Dante Alighieri which covers a journey to Hell.

Its orbital distance from the WD is 0.4 ls so close that it cannot actually be reached using supercruise (the WD drops the ship out of SC about 2 ls out). There is also a nearby M V companion star a few ls away. As an aside there is an unusually high number of Carbon Star systems around this location too.\r\n\r\nThe planet is so close to the WD that (a) it is within the WD's Roche Limit and should have been torn apart to form a ring system and (b) orbits faster than the WD's rotation period (which itself is only 16 minutes) and therefore is spiralling in to the WD anyway due to tidal forces. The system is also 7.8 billion years old - how the gas giant continues to survive how it got into its current orbit around the WD and how the WD and its planet both got so close to the M V star after the end of the WD's former red giant phase are all deep mysteries!\r\n\r\n[Link](https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=5357127&viewfull=1#post5357127)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n![Image](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/siQrCtUm.png \,

On the other hand due to the location visibility of the galactic disc is excellent and because the area of space contains a great deal of blue-white stars planetary skies are usually full of pretty bright lights. Finally the main POI system contains 17 landable planets which should provide ample opportunities to stock up on FSD injection and other materials.

Consequently Enlil was always regarded as being a bit wayward at one time even trying to drown mankind in a great flood.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical Winds of Enlil are a wayward object too and a bit of a conundrum since many characteristics associated with a 'classic' nebula seem to be missing. First the Winds do not have a core element like a stellar corpse from which the Winds may have originated. This alone would not pose too much of an explanatory problem but the complex also barely has any massive young stars or protostar population that would hint at star formation taking or having taken place. Instead most stars inside the complex are rather old M and K type stars that are from 1.5 to 6.8 billion years old. This may indicate that the Winds of Enlil are in fact moving through the area presumably being [_pulled in by the Milky Way's gravity_](http:\/\/www.space.com\/34337-massive-gas-cloud-will-collide-with-milky-way-eventually-video.html). A strong indicator for this theory is the fact that the Winds seem to be compressed or flattened at the top: Dust and gas accumulate here and the Winds' movement seems to be stalled. So what we see here may in fact be the formation of a dust cloud that will eventually turn into a Stellar Nursery in a couple of million years.

But something wasn't quite right... the Asp took longer than usual to touch down nearby the high walls of the Canyon that Bomba Luigi was in must have caused some confusion in the ship's navigation computer.\r\n\r\nCMDR Luigi targeted his ship over the Horizon and watched as the shields plummeted to zero... shortly followed by the hull. An explosion was heard in the distance.\r\n\r\nLuigi did what any experienced commander would do and called out to the exploration community for help. What followed must have exceeded Luigi's expectations with hundreds of commanders flooding the comm lines to offer their suggestions tips mapping help and to see how they can console this stranded commander.\r\n\r\nExplorers began to visit Luigi on the planet he'd aptly named 'Wilson'. The visitors delivered him canisters of supplies to keep him alive and also helped him fend off the incoming 'space madness' as well as assisting Luigi mapping the geography of his planet-sized prison. \r\n\r\nAfter three weeks stranded on Planet Wilson Luigi was rescued and safely returned to inhabited space.\r\n\r\n- Reference: [_'Help I need ship rats'_ (original transmission)](https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/268862-Help-I-need-Ship-Rats!),

It is an asymptotic giant branch star a luminous red giant in the late stages of evolution. As an asymptotic giant branch star its interior structure is characterized by a central and largely inert core of carbon and oxygen a shell where helium is undergoing fusion to form carbon (known as helium burning) another shell where hydrogen is undergoing fusion forming helium (known as hydrogen burning) and a very large envelope of material of composition similar to main-sequence stars.\r\n\r\n21st century Earth scientists wrote that the star was 'surrounded by a detached shell of dust and gas. The shell originates from a thermal pulse during which the star undergoes a brief period of increased mass loss.' The odd spiral structures in this dust cloud led to the discovery of R Sculptoris B a regular K-class main sequence star.\r\n\r\nReference : [Link](https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=5120726&viewfull=1#post5120726)\r\n\r\n![enter image description here](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/JozAQhUl.png \,

The region seems to have a much higher rate of star birth than other areas even compared to its relative vicinity to the galactic bulge and its core density. It is located between three prominent nebulae (Leviathan Veil of Inanna Flaming Torch) and is also dotted by supernova remnants and many black holes and neutron stars. The area has brought forth at least three distinct superclusters of primarily massive young stars of O and B types as well as numerous T Tauri Associations and quite a few 'pockets' with a high number of neutron stars black holes and the occasional Wolf-Rayet star. It is an explorer's heaven.\r\n\r\nAs concerns its origins it is thought that the Segnao Starburst lies at a 'hotspot' (the Orio-Perseian Conflux) of at least two of the galaxy's density waves that eventually evolve into the Orion-Cygnus and the Perseus spiral arm. The region thus should have an overabundancy of mass held in numerous gigantic molecular clouds. The starburst thus may have resulted from a series of supernovae jets blasting through the area that lead to a massive collapse of the Segnao giant molecular cloud. The area holds enough stellar corpses some of which are in excess of 50+ solar masses that would support this theory. The collapse of the cloud complex would have incited star formation at various spots at approximately the same time. The sheer output of young stars in this area is just staggering. \r\n[\r\nLink](https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=4666202&viewfull=1#post4666202)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n![enter image description here](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/rIX4eIUl.jpg \,

There are also many stellar corpses that bear witness to some gigantic catastrophes in the distant past.\r\n\r\nThe nebula is part of a much greater complex the Segnao Starburst. In fact it is quite likely that the Leviathan is just the remnant of a much bigger molecular cloud complex which must have collapsed in a chain of some rather dramatic events thus producing a rate of star birth far higher than in other parts.\r\n\r\n[Link](https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=4666202&viewfull=1#post4666202)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n![enter image description here](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/g2PZwZJl.jpg \,

She had seven holy vestments that on one occasion were stripped from her as she was about to visit her sister Ereshkigal in the underworld*. One of these vestments was a thin veil of many colours which she often used to \u201ethrow before the stars\u201c.\r\n\r\nThe Veil of Inanna is a predominantly blue and red emission nebula which is brightly illuminated by many young massive stars in its vicinity. Parts of the nebula are intersected by a thick and dense layer of dust which makes the nebula's appearance even more beautiful. The nebula is also part of a much greater complex the nearby Segnao Starburst. It is an area of extremly heavy star formation and it is thought that the Veil had its own share in the formation of the nearby superclusters. \r\n\r\nLink\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n![enter image description here](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jCGOUdCl.jpg \,
